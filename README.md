`react-decorate` is a framework for building compatible, composable, efficient decorators for applying behavior to [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) components.

Many libraries use higher-order-component decorators to help users apply behavior to [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) components.
`react-decorate` aims to establish a standard pattern for building higher-order-component decorators in such a way that they can be composed efficiently without adding one new component instance per decorator.
